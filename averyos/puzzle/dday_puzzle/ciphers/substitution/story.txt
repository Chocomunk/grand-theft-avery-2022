I’m worried about these ciphers. They are low tech, so I don’t think the Institution’s 
minions will spot them on first glance, and I’ve hidden them well. Only R. Stanton knows 
my secrets and I have confided everything in him. But I need to increase security. I 
think I saw one of them following me into work this morning, and I know they’ve spotted 
my trail online. Their transmissions have become infrequent and more heavily encrypted.
