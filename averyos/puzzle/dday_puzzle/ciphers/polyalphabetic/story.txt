We developed the Variant from a primordial strain. It's foundations predate all modern diseases, but our modifications 
have given it the power to topple governments. Highly transmissible, the first phase is an irrevocable addiction to boba 
and karaoke, followed by simultaneous delusions of intelligence and loss of generacy, eventually concluding in complete 
insanity. Nobody and nothing can withstand the Variant, and if even a single person becomes infected, it cannot be 
contained. With proper modifications, the Variant could be weaponized with a generational clock the renders it inert 
after a set number of transmissions, controlling the size of the infected population. The Institution could take over 
the whole world and remake it in their image if they get their hands on this. We cannot allow it!
