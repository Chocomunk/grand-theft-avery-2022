I've been tracking their progress. The Institution has been making moves across the entire underworld for months now. 
The Avery Family Tree has been put under surveillance and they're in regular meetings with Lord Mannion. They've even 
begun to undermine the powerful dining cartels with "Comfort Nights" and corrupting movies. I fear they may even have 
forced the Godfather to the negotiating table.

These people are everywhere. I see their schemes in everything but I don't know what their game is. I pray they don't 
know about the Variant. I shudder to think what power they would hold with such a weapon in their hands.

Note: All of my algorithms (railfence, scytale, and columnar) operate in five columns, without further keys.
