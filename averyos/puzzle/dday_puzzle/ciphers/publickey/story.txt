I've had a break in the case! I intercepted a message from the Institution. I think they're using a public key cipher, 
but I'm not sure what they've said. If the Institution thinks this public key business is safe enough for them, it 
should be safe enough for me. I've sent R. Stanton Avery an encrypted message with my latest suspicions. But while he 
works to decode my message, I need to think about how to crack the Institution's codes.
