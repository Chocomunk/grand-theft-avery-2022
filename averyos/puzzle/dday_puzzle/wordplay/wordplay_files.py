I’ve been so busy lately that I haven’t been able to keep up with my journaling at all! After my first day, I was called 
into the office and asked to discuss what I’ve worked on in the past. They then asked me if I would be interested in 
working on a new up-and-coming team, which I replied affirmatively of course. I’ve been working with incredible equipment 
and talented researchers ever since, so I’ve been busier than ever. It is fascinating!

I’m so glad I had the opportunity to talk about my work in the office yesterday. I had explained my previous research and 
works to my superiors, and they were all extremely impressed.

They were especially interested in my prior biomedical work featuring unique strain development, which I was pleasantly 
surprised about, since my specific field is quite niche. I hope my research can help humanity.

I’ve been working quite hard in the lab. Endless work days and tiring work nights, but it is truly thrilling to see all 
the progress we’ve made so far. Even though I joined the team recently, they are also a relatively new project themselves,

I’m not entirely sure what we are trying to find, but we’ve been playing around with various modifications and seeing 
what happens, which is personally something I very much enjoy.

We bonded over our humanitarian interests especially. I’m glad to find a compassionate ally in this Institution.

Things are getting serious. The Institution has caught on about their flaws in their security, and now surveillance is

I am racking my brain to remember if I have had any conversations lately that could put me in a compromising situation. 
Who did I talk to? What did I say? If I have made even the most minute of slip-ups, it could be the end of not only my 
life, but also the world as we know it, once the Institution gets ahold of the Variant.
