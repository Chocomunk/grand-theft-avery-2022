Clouds of chalk dust sat suspended in the air as Dinakar scrawled furiously, pressing each and every variable and number 
deeply into the surface of the chalkboard. The blinds were closed, blocking out the natural moonlight which he had 
replaced with a single fluorescent lamp to illuminate his surroundings. Dinakar preferred to work in the dark and into 
the night, likening himself to some sort of mad scientist working by candle light, discovering the laws of the universe. 
The chalk Dinakar clutched tightly in his cramping hands, full and fresh just a mere fifteen minutes ago, had been 
reduced to a mere nub.

“Damn it, I need a fresh one. I'm so close too,” muttered Dinakar. He tossed the chalk onto a pile of twelve other stubs 
that lay cast aside in a sad, discarded pile. Dinakar likened these sacrificial lambs to his mathematical ritual.

Startled, Dinakar whirled around to find a stocky silhouette leaning cooly against the open door frame. However, even 
with the mysterious individual's face obscured in the partial shadow, Dinakar instantly knew to whom the voice belonged.

“Why are you still here, Dr. Katz? It's midnight. Shouldn't you be at home with your wife?”, questioned Dinakar, his 
voice quivering slightly.

The figure stepped into the soft light of the lamp to reveal a bearded man with thick wire-frame glasses dressed casually 
in a black t-shirt tucked smartly into a pair of faded jeans. He pushed back the curly locks of hair that dangled behind 
a robust bald-spot. The corners of his mouth barely tilting upwards in a half-cocked smile, exhibiting a self-satisfied 
smugness. His eyes seemed to sparkle in the weak glow of the lamp that bathed him in an angelic glow.

Before Dinakar stood Nets Katz, mathematics genius, professor, and heartthrob of the California Institute of Technology. 
Classes with Dr. Katz were the very definition of “pleasure with pain.” Students agonized over his near-impossible sets 
but piled into lecture halls just for a mere glimpse of his captivating beauty. Dinakar was by no means immune to his 
charms. In fact, it was quite the opposite.

From the very first time they had locked eyes in the teacher's lounge, Dinakar had fallen hopelessly and madly in love 
with Dr. Katz.

Dinakar suspected the identity of the mysterious figure, yet he nervously scrambled for another piece of silky, white, 
smooth chalk. He could not be derailed from his work, for if it was who he believed it to be, it was the end of a 
productive night. At least one of mathematical production. The voice uttered once more, but this time in a soothing tone. 
“I know you can hear me, and I know you want to turn around. You want to more than anything.” The voice was right. 
Dinakar began shaking as if he were a schoolboy ogling over his curvaceous, recently-divorced homeroom teacher. The urge 
to turn grew stronger and stronger…and longer and harder. His will was rapidly breaking, and suddenly the voice boomed 
“TURN!” There was only thing Dinakar could do.

“Why are you always so formal with me, Di-Di? Besides, I could ask you the same question.” Katz laughed softly and 
continued towards Dinakar, who stood frozen in place as he approached. With every step Nets took, Dinakar could feel his 
heart thudding harder and harder, threatening to break free from the prison of his ribcage. Despite being two inches 
taller than Dr. Katz, Dinakar couldn’t help but feel dwarfed by his presence. Dr. Katz boasted an aura of quiet 
confidence and swagger that made Dinakar’s knees tremble with wild passion. Beads of nervous sweat began to gather at 
the crest of Dinakar’s forehead, threatening to trickle down in thick torrents and expose his restlessness.

Dinakar immediately dropped to his knees. The sight of the whole of Katz was simply too great to ignore. Nets Katz was 
not merely his colleague, not even just his better. Nets Katz was a god among men, as far as mathematicians can be 
reasonably considered men. This display of submission awakened a curt smirk on Nets’ face. The sight of Dinakar’s plump 
belly leaking over his waist induced a noticeably turgid spot to develop on Nets’ jeans, just in front of his crown 
jewels. Nets softly motioned Dinakar to rise, just as his trousers had done. And of course, Dinakar complied.

“So why are you here so late, Di-Di?”, murmured Nets, his face nearly brushing against Dinakar’s. Dinakar swallowed

“Damn it, how am I so flustered?” thought Dinakar. He could feel Nets scanning over every inch of his face, beckoning 
Dinakar to return his eye contact like a Siren calling a sailor to sea. The same sparkling eyes that Dinakar felt himself 
getting lost in, the same eyes that Dinakar knew he would only fall deeper and deeper into if he gave into his most 
primal desire. 

But the call was too much. Dinakar could feel his will to resist faltering. His gaze sliding back to meet Nets’ gaze.

The emotion overcame Dinakar, and he sought to display his love physically. With an impressively quick flick of the wrist, 
Dinakar’s undid his zipper and retrieved his manhood. From his pants tumbled out a cock of considerable proportions. For 
a moment, Nets was surprised, until he realized the kind of man Dinakar was. Of course he would seek to impress him. Of 
course he was overcome with his magnificence. But Nets did not want to spoil the surprise, as a gift should not be opened 
prematurely. While shielding his eyes, Nets walked over to Dinakar and took his still-flaccid junk in his hand. Nets 
couldn’t help but love the feeling of it draping over his palm. “There’ll be time for this later,” whispered Nets Katz, 
as he neatly tucked the penis back into Dinakar’s pants. As Nets returned to his spot, Dinakar couldn’t help but feel 
diminished. He returned to his previous reserved demeanor, stood still, and waited for Nets’ approval.

Dinakar took a step back and his leg collided with the desk, scattering the pile of nubs. The sound of chalk falling to 
the ground echoed throughout the empty room, breaking Dinakar’s trance. Dinakar instinctively dropped to his knees to 
pick up the chalk fragments. Nets stooped down to help him out. They worked in silence to retrieve the pieces as Dinakar 
kept his eyes trained on the floor. As Dinakar felt his fingers brush Nets’, he slowly looked up to find Nets’ staring 
right back at him, their noses joined by the tips. Dinakar looked away bashfully, but Nets made no movement, continuing 
to stare directly at Dinakar. Neither made a sound for a moment.
